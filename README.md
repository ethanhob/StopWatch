# Stop Watch
This stopwatch has a main timer and lap timer and converts the computers internal clock to a readable format. 

This used es5 javascript but can easily be converted to es6 and uses flex displays and vh/vw css styling

This uses downloaded css, js and font family styles just for an added challenge. Every other project used CDN's to integrate these
